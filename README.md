**XTEND-AI** is an innovative AI-powered chat assistant designed to support students in extending their learning capabilities. Built with cutting-edge technologies, XTEND-AI offers a unique approach to education by providing hints, asking insightful questions, and guiding students through parallel problems and examples rather than giving direct answers.

Powered by the Phi-3-mini-4k model running locally in your browser via WebLLM, XTEND-AI ensures privacy and offline functionality, making it an ideal tool for learners everywhere.

## Features

- **Educational Support**: Guides students through learning with hints, questions, and relevant examples instead of direct solutions.
- **Local AI Processing**: Utilizes WebLLM to run the Phi-3-mini-4k model directly in your browser, ensuring data privacy.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Responses are formatted using Markdown syntax for clear and structured communication.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A sleek, user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the AI.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any modern web browser without the need for installation (beyond initial model download).

## How It Works

XTEND-AI leverages the power of machine learning to assist students in subjects like mathematics, science, and more. For instance, in mathematics, it generates parallel problems with different variables and walks through solutions step-by-step. The AI maintains context throughout the conversation, providing personalized assistance.

## Purpose

XTEND-AI is a private, free project created by Brytan Kelly in 2025 under the MIT License. Its purpose is to serve as an extension of a person's intelligence, helping individuals grow rather than doing all the work for them. Designed with safety in mind, XTEND-AI is suitable for school environments, ensuring a supportive and educational interaction that fosters learning and critical thinking.

## Installation

XTEND-AI is a web-based application that requires no traditional installation. However, it does need to download the AI model to run locally in your browser. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arctic-Bio/xtend-ai.git
   ```
2. **Open the Application**:
   - Navigate to the cloned directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. **Model Download**:
   - Upon first launch, the WebLLM framework will download the Phi-3-mini-4k model. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.
   - Once downloaded, the model runs locally, and no further internet access is required for operation.

**Note**: Ensure your browser supports WebAssembly and has sufficient storage for the model (approximately 2-3 GB).

## Usage

1. **Launch XTEND-AI**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Wait for the loading screen to complete as the model initializes.
2. **Interact with the AI**:
   - Type your query or topic of interest in the chat input area.
   - XTEND-AI will respond with formatted guidance using Markdown for clarity.
3. **Explore Learning**:
   - Ask about specific subjects, request examples, or seek help with problem-solving.
   - The AI will maintain conversation context for a personalized experience.
